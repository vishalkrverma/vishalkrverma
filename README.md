- Integrating REST APIs into frontends for dynamic data handling
- Styling with modern UI tools like **Tailwind CSS** and **Material UI**

### 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Solving problems on platforms like **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **GeeksforGeeks**
- Mastering recursion, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, trees, and graphs.
- Improving time-space complexity analysis and coding efficiency

### 📊 Data Science Foundations
- Hands-on experience with **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**
- Understanding basics of **data wrangling**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and simple **visualizations**
- Planning to dive deeper into **machine learning** and real-world data sets

### 🌍 Open Source & Collaboration
- Exploring open-source contribution opportunities on GitHub
- Learning best practices for clean commits, branching, pull requests, and collaborative workflows
- Planning to contribute to beginner-friendly repositories and documentation-based PRs
